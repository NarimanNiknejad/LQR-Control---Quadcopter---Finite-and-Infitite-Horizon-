This repository contains a Python script quadrotor.py that implements a decentralized LQR controller for a quadrotor. The quadrotor's nonlinear dynamics are linearized into four subsystems and a decentralized LQR controller is designed for each subsystem. The performance of the controller is evaluated using numerical simulations.
